									Recent surveys suggest an increasing number of people prefer renting properties over buying, implying less incentives to own furniture. FrnT is a community based, crowd-sourced furniture-sharing rental website allowing users to search and post furniture listings for rentals in their proximity. Users will be able to search furniture based on characteristics such as pricing, style and location.
