#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

Recent surveys suggests that an increasing number of people prefer renting properties over buying, implying less of an incentive to owning furniture. FrnT is a community based, crowd-sourced furniture-sharing rental website, allowing users to search and post furniture listings for rentals in their vicinity. Users will be able to search furniture based on characteristics such as pricing, style and location.

The final product will be available as a web application across all platforms.

#### Q2: Who are your target users?

Our target users are mainly college students and millenials who move homes very frequently.

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem?

Owning furniture is a pain; moving them is a hassle, especially between cities. Furnishing is hard for students and young professionals who do not own homes in highly populated cities such as San Francisco, NYC and Toronto where renting is the norm. Frnt is a platform for users to lease their extra furnitures to people for short periods of time.

Frnt allows people to have beautifully designed homes while saving lots of money. Seasonal visitors would be able to experience the local artisanal furniture culture without committing to ownership, and redesigned their entire home when their lease is over.
