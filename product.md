#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

Recent surveys suggest an increasing number of people prefer renting properties over buying, which implies less incentives to own furniture. FrnT is a community based, crowd-sourced furniture-sharing rental website that allows users to search and post furniture listings for rentals in their proximity. Users will be able to search furniture based on characteristics such as pricing, style and location.

The final product will be available as a web application across all platforms.

#### Q2: Who are your target users?

Our target users are mainly college students and millenials who like to move homes, or re-design frequently.

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem?

Frnt is a platform where users can lease/rent furnitures for short periods of time.

Furnishing new homes can be a chore for students and young professionals who do not own homes in highly populated cities such as San Francisco, NYC and Toronto where renting is the norm. Owning furniture is a pain; moving is a hassle.

Frnt allows people to have beautifully designed homes while potentially saving lots of money. Seasonal visitors would be able to experience the local artisanal furniture culture without committing to ownership, renovate as frequently as they want.
