## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: October 16, 2016
 * Where: Online (via Google Hangouts)

## Process - Reflection

(Optional) Short introduction

During our planning meeting, we were able to decide on an idea and justify why it's a valuable product for our user group. Through the guidance of tutorials, we had a chance to reflect on the key features that would distinguish our product from alternatives and meet the functional requirements of our users. 

Decisions turned out well:

 * List a few (2-5) decisions, from most to least important.
 * Support your argument (that a decisions was successful) by referring/linking to process artifact(s).

Decisions did not turn out as well as you hoped:

 * Once again, list a few (2 - 5) decisions, from most to least important.
 * As before, support your arguments by referring/linking to process artifacts.

We are planning to make the following changes to our process:

 * List the changes you are planning to make, if any, from most to least important.
 * For each change, explain why you are making it by referring to a decision that didn't work well.


## Product - Review

Goals/tasks that were met/completed:

 * List goals/tasks, from most to least important.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.
 * For each goal/task, refer to artifact(s) that show that it was met/completed.

 * Static landing page 
 * Diagram of workflow narrative 

Goals/tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * List goals/tasks, from most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

 * Design spec document 

(Optional) Goals/tasks that were not originally planned, but ended up being not met/completed:

 * List goals/tasks, from most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why you decided to change your plan and add this goal/task.


Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * List the few (2-5) high-level concepts that should guide your work for the next few weeks.
 * These concepts should help you prioritize features and decide on where to focus your efforts.
