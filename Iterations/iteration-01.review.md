## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: October 16, 2016
 * Where: Online (via Google Hangouts)

## Process - Reflection

(Optional) Short introduction

During our planning meeting, we were able to decide on an idea and justify why it's a valuable product for our user group. Through the guidance of tutorials, we had a chance to reflect on the key features that would distinguish our product from alternatives and meet the functional requirements of our users. 

Decisions turned out well:

 - Setting up our communication tools was the most important decision we made since it was crucial that we had a reliable form of communication to set-up meetings and work away from each other.
 - In-person meetings were fairly efficient when we do get together; a good amount of work was completed.

 
Decisions did not turn out as well as you hoped:

 - Our merging process was inefficient and a lot of overlapping conflicts occurred.
 - Getting every single member to meet up in-person everytime was difficult as we all had different schedules and some members lived fairly far away from optimal meeting locations.


We are planning to make the following changes to our process:

 - Changing up the merging process would be our immediate priority. One member proposes to write up a document that identifies and suggests resolutions for conflicting merges to avoid further issues and improve efficiency


## Product - Review

Goals/tasks that were met/completed:

 - Creating the static landing page early is a good idea as well for visualizing the workflow of the website. We can get a sense of what the website looks like without having to go as far as to code in the backend immediately.
 - Creating a diagram for the workflow of the application as one of our first steps was also useful as it acts as a blueprint and helps us visualize when we create the website.


Goals/tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 - Setting up the task on step-by-step guides for processes from picking up an item from the backlog to releasin an update. We are currently too early into the process to make use of it.

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 - Attempt to maintain a consistent, concise idea of what we are attempting to build
 - Prioritize the larger goals/features of the website before working into the more detailed features
