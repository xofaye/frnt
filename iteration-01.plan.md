## Iteration 01

## Process

We will adopt the agile process with weekly scrum meetings. Contributions to the project will be via pull request only, with strict code review guidelines and via rebase.

#### Roles & responsibilities

Describe the different roles (e.g. developers, communication facilitator, proof-reader, etc.) on the team, and the responsibilities associated with each role.

 * Planning meeting (online): 
     * Identify problem being solved 
     * Decide on product functionality

 * Review meeting: 
     * 

#### Artifacts

Please describe the artifacts that you will produce in order to organize and keep track of your team's progress.       
For example:
 * To-do lists, burndown chart, schedule, etc.
 * If you include charts/diagrams, make sure to explain what they represent.
 * If you're maintaining a to-do list, make sure to mention which tool you're using, how you are prioritizing items and how items get assigned to team members.


## Product

Goals and tasks:

 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * When listing goals/tasks, order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

Artifacts

 * Describe the artifacts (diagrams, interactive mock-ups, wireframes, actual code, etc.)
   that you are planning to produce by the end of (and during) this iteration.
 * Be precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
